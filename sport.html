                <h3><strong>NBA season preview: LeBron James is Come back!.</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Just 72 days earlier</strong>  the Lakers - led by LeBron James - had celebrated winning the NBA title at Disney World in Florida. Now, they are getting ready to start again.
                As is tradition, the members of the title-winning team will each be given a diamond-encrusted ring on opening night to mark their achievement. Yet Covid-19 restrictions mean the celebration will be a quiet one - as the Staples Center will be empty.
                This will be an NBA campaign with a difference. There will be 72 regular-season games instead of the usual 82. Some arenas will have fans while others won't. Only the first half of the season's schedule has been published. And the season is scheduled to end in May.</p>

               <p>King James' reign set to continue?
                It's testament to LeBron James' natural-born talent and his documented hard work that, at the age of 35, he is still considered the league's best player. This will be his 18th season as a professional.
                When James signed for the Lakers in 2018, he said trophies would follow. Last year, he delivered on that promise. A large portion of the credit, though, must be awarded to his running-mate Anthony Davis.
                The Lakers have refreshed their roster - with some believing the team is better than last year. The talk around the league is that this title is theirs to lose rather than anyone else's to win.
